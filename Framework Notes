Allure Report command:
allure serve
allure serve target/allure-results
allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
allure serve C:\Users\jedgal001\Desktop\Disclosure_IJ\allure-report
allure generate 'C:\Users\jedgal001\Desktop\Disclosure_IJ\allure-report' && allure open
allure generate 'C\Users\jedgal001\Desktop\Disclosure_IJ\allure-report' && allure open

Troubleshooting:
If 'regression_FRS102_103_105_Mainchecklist' fails while a section in progress:
1) In RegrsssionFRS.java, change 'hs.answerSections' to 'hs.answerSectionsInProgress'
2) In FRS102_103_105, go to method 'mainCheckListResponse' and change 'withSkipLines(0)'
   value to match value of section in progress

Tips:
1) Delete content in Difference.csv, DiscloseResponses.csv & DiscrepanciesFile.csv before every run
2) When comparing two files replace contents of both Data_FRS102.csv & Data_FRS102 - Copy.csv OR
   In CompareCSVFilesPage.java, go to compareCSVFiles method and change value of fileNameINWrite
   to DiscloseResponses.csv

DRAFTS:
String[] col= new String[3];
String[] col2= new String[35];

col[0] = questionTextVal;
col[1] = Title;
col[2] = questionDiscription;

col2[29] = questionTextVal;
col2[30] = Title;
col2[31] = questionDiscription;

            writer.writeNext(col);
