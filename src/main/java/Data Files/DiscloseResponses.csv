"T1.1.1","Purpose of the checklist","The purpose of this checklist is to assist experienced accountants in determining whether financial statements comply with the disclosure requirements of: 

- FRS 101 and/or relevant  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as endorsed for use in the European Union or the United Kingdom from 1st January 2021 (post-Brexit); 
- International Accounting Standards (IASs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) and adopted by the IASB that are endorsed for use in the in the European Union; and ; 
- Interpretations issued by International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) predecessor body, the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) that are endorsed for use in the European Union. IFRSs, IASs, IFRICs, and SICs are referred to collectively in this checklist as IFRSs. 

As well as IFRS, various UK specific disclosures are included in the checklist. These include relevant disclosures derived from: - FRS 101, The Companies Acts (2006) & supporting legislation affecting accounts, directors' remuneration reports, & directors' reports; - AIM and Listing Rules; - The UK Corporate Governance Code; - Investment and Venture Capital Trusts SORP; - Guidelines for Portfolio Companies and Private Equity firms; - Guidance on the Strategic Report June 2014; - Summary financial statements; and - Preliminary announcements. There are also some example wordings for UK audit reports.  This also includes voluntary banking disclosure including: CEBS principles for disclosure in times of stress
CESR statement FV measurements and related disclosures of financial instruments in illiquid markets
ESMA statement on disclosures related to sovereign debt
IOSC report of the task force on the subprime crisis
SSG leading practice disclosures for selected exposures
FSB enhancing the disclosures of banks
FSB principles for sound compensation practices
FSA forbearance and impairment provisions","A"
"T1.1.2","Listing Rules","The checklist does not deal with Listing Rule and Disclosure and Transparency Rules requirements for entities that are not incorporated in the United Kingdom. They should instead consult the Listing Rules and Disclosure and Transparency Rules directly.","A"
"T1.1.3","Purpose of the checklist","We have tried to ensure that all requirements are included in the checklist and that the link between the tailoring questions and the disclosure requirements is robust. However we can give no warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the software. It still remains the responsibility of the user to ensure that the financial statements comply with all disclosure requirements. Please be aware that this checklist does not cover the recognition, measurement and presentation requirements of IFRSs, although reference to these aspects of standards are made where is it is considered relevant, for example in help screens giving background information on disclosure requirements. Note: This checklist should generally only be used for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 March 2012. Where the financial statements are for a period beginning before this date, please contact Pentana in order to ascertain the most suitable checklist to apply in your scenario.","A"
"T1.1.4","Introduction","The user's answers to the tailoring questions will impact the disclosures identified as applicable to the financial statements in the detailed disclosure requirements section of the checklist. For example, if the user specifies that the entity does not have intangible assets in its financial statements, the user will not be prompted with the disclosure requirements applicable to intangible assets. It is therefore imperative that these questions are answered accurately. In order to answer the tailoring assumptions accurately the user must have a good understanding of the entity as well as the recognition, measurement and presentation requirements of all IFRSs applicable to the entity's financial statements You have to answer all tailoring questions before you can proceed with the detailed disclosure questions. In the case of a parent entity preparing consolidated financial statements, references to ""entity"" apply equally to its consolidated financial statements as well as its separate financial statements (if prepared) except for the following: · If a single financial report contains both consolidated financial statements and the separate financial statements of the parent, segment disclosures required by IAS 14 'Segment Reporting' or IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' only need to be presented on the basis of the consolidated financial statements; and · If the entity presents both consolidated financial statements and separate financial statements, disclosures required by IAS 33 'Earnings per Share' only need to be presented on the basis of consolidated financial statements.","A"
